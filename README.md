# 🏠 Property Comparison & Price Prediction App (Junior Full Stack Developer Case Study)

Welcome! This is a case study for evaluating junior full stack developer candidates at Agent Mira.

## 🎯 Objective

Build a web application that:
- Accepts two property addresses as input
- Scrapes or uses mocked data to retrieve key property features
- Compares properties side-by-side
- Uses a provided ML model to predict their estimated price
- Displays results in a simple, clean web interface

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn and Show Us

- Frontend development using modern JS frameworks
- Backend API design in Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- Data processing and handling unstructured inputs
- Integrating a real model object for prediction
- Thinking through edge cases and business logic

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Recommended)

- Frontend: React, HTML/CSS, Tailwind
- Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- Tools: Docker (optional), GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Postman

---

## 🔗 Files Provided

- `complex_price_model_v2.pkl`: Serialized model file
- `model_interface.md`: Description of model input schema
- `backend/main.py`: Starter backend script (optional use)
- `README.md`: This file

---

## 🚀 Task Details

1. Build a frontend with two input fields for property addresses.
2. On clicking "Compare", send the addresses to the backend.
3. Backend should:
   - Scrape or simulate property data
   - Prepare data using the correct schema
   - Load and invoke the provided ML model
4. Return estimated price and features for each property.
5. Show the results side-by-side in the frontend.

## ✅ What I Built (Features)

- **Address-based compare flow (frontend)**: I built a UI with two address inputs and a “Compare” action. When you submit, it calls the backend and renders a side-by-side comparison card for each property.

- **Mock data generation (backend)**: Since the prompt explicitly allows mocked data, I generate realistic-ish property attributes from the input address. The same address always produces the same output (deterministic hashing), and I bias values by recognized cities (e.g., NYC / SF tend to be higher priced and more condo-like).
  - **Generated fields** include bedrooms, bathrooms, size, year built, amenities, pool/garage flags, and a school rating.

- **Schema alignment to `model_interface.md`**: The backend transforms the generated mock features into the exact model input schema:
  - `property_type` is `"SFH"` or `"Condo"`
  - `lot_area` is used only for `"SFH"` and `building_area` only for `"Condo"`
  - `school_rating` is constrained to 1–10

- **Model loading + prediction**: The backend loads the provided `complex_price_model_v2.pkl` and exposes prediction through the compare flow so each property returns a `predicted_price`.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /compare-addresses`: takes `{ address_1, address_2 }` and returns both properties + predictions
  - `GET /lookup-address`: takes `address=...` and returns one property + prediction

## 🧩 Challenges I Faced

- **The provided pickle wasn’t a “real” saved model**: When I first tried to load `complex_price_model_v2.pkl`, I hit an error because it referenced a class (`ComplexTrapModelRenamed`) that didn’t exist in my runtime. After inspecting the pickle, I realized it contained only a class instance reference and no stored parameters/weights/state, so there was nothing to “run” unless I recreated the missing class.

- **Making the model usable while still honoring the provided file**: To keep it faithful to the prompt (“use the provided ML model”), I implemented the missing class and a predictable `predict()` method, and I used a custom unpickler that maps `__main__.ComplexTrapModelRenamed` to my implementation so the provided `.pkl` can still be loaded.

- **Turning unstructured addresses into structured model inputs**: Addresses are messy strings, but the model expects a strict schema. I handled this by generating mock features deterministically from the address (so demos are reproducible) and then carefully mapping them into the exact schema described in `model_interface.md` (including the `lot_area` vs `building_area` conditional).

- **Keeping local dev and deployment paths clean**: I made the frontend call the API via `/api` in production (Vercel) and `http://127.0.0.1:8000` locally, so it works both when developing and when deployed.

## 📥 Model Integration Guide

Import and use like this:
```python
import pickle

with open('complex_price_model_v2.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

prediction = model.predict({
    "property_type": "SFH",
    "lot_area": 5000,
    "building_area": 0,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    "year_built": 2015,
    "has_pool": True,
    "has_garage": False,
    "school_rating": 9
})
```
